  <i><h2><p>Artificial Intelligence refers to the intelligence of machines. This is in contrast to the natural intelligence of humans and animals. With Artificial Intelligence, machines perform functions such as learning, planning, reasoning and problem-solving. Most noteworthy, Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It is probably the fastest-growing development in the World of technology and innovation. Furthermore, many experts believe AI could solve major challenges and crisis situations.
  </p></h2></i><br>
  <I><h2><p>First of all, the categorization of Artificial Intelligence is into four types. Arend Hintze came up with this categorization. The categories are as follows:
  </p></h2></I><br>
  <i><h2><p>*Type 1: Reactive machines – These machines can react to situations. A famous example can be Deep Blue, the IBM chess program. Most noteworthy, the chess program won against Garry Kasparov, the popular chess legend. Furthermore, such machines lack memory. These machines certainly cannot use past experiences to inform future ones. It analyses all possible alternatives and chooses the best one.
  </p></h2></i><br>
  <i><h2><p>*Type 2: Limited memory – These AI systems are capable of using past experiences to inform future ones. A good example can be self-driving cars. Such cars have decision making systems. The car makes actions like changing lanes. Most noteworthy, these actions come from observations. There is no permanent storage of these observations.
  </p></h2></i><br>
  <i><h2><p>*Type 3: Theory of mind – This refers to understand others. Above all, this means to understand that others have their beliefs, intentions, desires, and opinions. However, this type of AI does not exist yet.
  </p></h2></i><br>
  <i><h2><p>*Type 4: Self-awareness – This is the highest and most sophisticated level of Artificial Intelligence. Such systems have a sense of self. Furthermore, they have awareness, consciousness, and emotions. Obviously, such type of technology does not yet exist. This technology would certainly be a revolution.
  </p></h2></i><br>
  <i><h2><p>The concept of Artificial Intelligence has been around for a long time. In fact, John McCarthy created the term Artificial Intelligence in 1950 and Alan Turing already started talking about this reality that same year in an article entitled “Computing Machinery and Intelligence”.

    Since then this discipline of computer science has evolved a lot.
    
    For Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Patrick H. Winston, IA are “constraint enabled algorithms exposed by representations that support looping models that link thought, perception and action. ”
    
    Other authors, such as DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin, define artificial intelligence as a computer system that is used for machines to perform work that requires human intelligence.
    
    For the head of Tech Target’s technological encyclopedia, Margaret Rose, it is a system that simulates different human processes such as learning, reasoning and self-correction.
    
    As we can see, the three definitions of AI refer to machines or computer systems that think. They emit reasoning emulating human intelligence to perform tasks that only people can do.
