    <i><h2><p>*1. High Costs:-<br>
            The ability to create a machine that can simulate human intelligence is no small feat. It requires plenty of time and resources and can cost a huge deal of money. AI also needs to operate on the latest hardware and software to stay updated and meet the latest requirements, thus making it quite costly.</p></h2></i><br>
    <i><h2><p>*2. No creativity:-<br>
            A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach. A classic example is the bot Quill who can write Forbes earning reports. These reports only contain data and facts already provided to the bot. Although it is impressive that a bot can write an article on its own, it lacks the human touch present in other Forbes articles. </p></h2></i><br>
    <i><h2><p>*3. Increase in Unemployment:-<br>
            Perhaps one of the biggest disadvantages of artificial intelligence is that AI is slowly replacing a number of repetitive tasks with bots. The reduction in the need for human interference has resulted in the death of many job opportunities. A simple example is the chatbot which is a big advantage to organizations, but a nightmare for employees. A study by McKinsey predicts that AI will replace at least 30 percent of human labour by 2030.</p></h2></i><br>
    <i><h2><p>*4. Make Humans Lazy:-<br>
            AI applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations.</p></h2></i><br>
    <i><h2><p>*5. No Ethics:-<br>
            Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity.</p></h2></i><br>
